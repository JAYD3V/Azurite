# DRESS TO IMPRESS: "The VS Code Get-fitted Extension"

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Azurite is a theme for V.S. code. It is deeply developed, and highly customized.
Few themes attempt to color the full array of theme'able properties that VS Code
has made available to its users.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Azurite is styled using deep blues that resemble the Azurite minerals found deep
within the earths crust, and the deepest depths of the abyssal depths of the
Mariana Trench. The icons that VS Code implements throughout its UI are
consistently colored using incandescent fiery  orange hues. The icons, can at
times, look like dots of hot glowing iron. Still, Azurite impresses further, by
implementing a neon green that offsets the fiery orange by creating a perfect
color harmony. Contrasted by the deep shades of blue, the illuminating green
highlights look as if they are glowing, like little neon green florescent lights
placed around the theme.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No doubt, Azurite is a beautiful theme, but that was never the primary focus.
The goal has always been, and always will be, to produce a high quality theme
that is is both very practical & highly readable. I feel Azurite achieves this
with great success by following a couple of key strategy's. The first is to
style the theme in such a way that it makes the features gifted to us by the
V.S. Code developers, more functional, as opposed to making them less usable.
The other strategy is to use tools to algorithmically choose colors. When you
work with colors regularly you know that a few points of color creates a totally
new color"#A0AAAA" will create a green tint, where "#AAA" will always be
perfectly white. This is why its important to use algorithms when first building
a UI for any platform, or a color framework/library. It helps get the UI to a
more defined, sharper place, than when they are not used.

## **Functional Features**

I mentioned making features more usable, and functional above. The features
listed below, are features that Azurite adds functionality to, simply by styling
their colors in a smart and thought-out manner.

<br>

1. **Slightly Transparent Menus & Editor-widgets**
    * Don't worry, they are not so transparent that readability goes out the
    window. They are just slightly transparent so that you can make out text that
    you need to see in the event that a menu you open covers something you need
    to be able to see while making a selection. _I personally find this very
    handy._

<br>

2. **Consistent SCM Decorations Color-palette that Closely Mimics GitHub's SCM Palette**
    * I really stuck to my guns when it came to SCM highlighting. I didn't
    always like the way that the colors for Modified or Added code looked in the
    dif editor, or in the file-explorer, as a consequence, the theme had to be
    coerced into matching the colors. I must say, I wound up very happy with the
    end result, and now the SCM decorations are
       1. Yellow: **`Modified`**
       2. Green: **`Added`**
       3. Pink/Red **`Deleted`**
       4. Violet **`Renamed`**
       5. Ignored **`Transparent White`**

    * It isn't exactly what GitHub implements, but its close enough that when a
    person uses it, who is familiar with GitHub, they will immediately know what
    the decoration's colors mean.
