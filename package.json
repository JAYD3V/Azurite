    "description": "One of the things that has been developed for VSCode, that there's a big gap for, is a customizable theme. Something between a fully custom configured environment (which is basically the development of your own theme), and using someone elses theme as they have built it. This repositories project delivers  a VSC theme that takes advantage of the VSCode extensible API, and implements into it, the Native JSON Parsing features included in JavaScript. The result is a theme that is customizable, and looks better than any other theme available, all with just a couple of clicks.",
