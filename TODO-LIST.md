##### #1 Create SVG Icons that display color in README Document

##### #2 Add Grammar for implementing customized comments using special initializer instructions w/ special characters

- **For example:**

```
// -> I am a comment, that arrow you see makes me a different color.
// * I am a different color because the '*' character was used as a coloring directive.
```

##### #3 Add a grammar for customizing syntax, like TODO lists. 

##### #4 Add a badge to a todo list widget in sidebar. Connect it to a parser that finds all todo's in a file.
